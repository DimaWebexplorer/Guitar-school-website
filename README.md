# Guitar-school-website
## Description project

This is a pet project that I made to practice with html and css. I used sass preprocessor to compile styles to style.css, used media queries for adaptive layout,
experimented with sass variables, added fonts. The website was built with Flexbox.

This project is better viewed with VS Code (plagins: Live Server, Live Sass Compiler).
